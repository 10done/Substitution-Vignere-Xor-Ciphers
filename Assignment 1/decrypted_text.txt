UGRASRAVA
 THE SON OF LOMAHARSHANA
 SURNAMED SAUTI
 WELL VERSED IN THE PURANAS
 BENDING WITH HUMILITY ONE DAY APPROACHED THE GREAT SAGES OF RIGID VOWS
 SITTING AT THEIR EASE WHO HAD ATTENDED THE TWELVE YEARS' SACRIFICE OF SAUNAKA
 SURNAMED KULAPATI
 IN THE FOREST OF NAIMISHA
 THOSE ASCETICS
 WISHING TO HEAR HIS WONDERFUL NARRATIONS
 PRESENTLY BEGAN TO ADDRESS HIM WHO HAD THUS ARRIVED AT THAT RECLUSE ABODE OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST OF NAIMISHA
 HAVING BEEN ENTERTAINED WITH DUE RESPECT BY THOSE HOLY MEN
 HE SALUTED THOSE MUNIS (SAGES) WITH JOINED PALMS
 EVEN ALL OF THEM
 AND INQUIRED OF THE PROGRESS OF THEIR ASCETICISM
 THEN ALL THE ASCETICS
 BEING AGAIN SEATED
 THE SON OF LOMAHARSHANA HUMBLY OCCUPIED THE SEAT THAT WAS ASSIGNED TO HIM
 SEEING THAT HE WAS COMFORTABLY SEATED AND RECOVERED FROM FATIGUE
 ONE OF THE RISHIS
 BEGINNING THE CONVERSATION
 ASKED HIM
 
`HENCE COMEST THOU
 O LOTUSLEAFEYED SAUTI
 AND WHERE HAST THOU SPENT THE TIME? TELL ME
 WHO ASK THEE
 IN FULL?


ACCOMPLISHED IN SPEECH
 SAUTI
 THUS QUESTIONED
 GAVE
 IN THE MIDST OF THAT SPACIOUS ASSEMBLAGE OF CONTEMPLATIVE MUNIS
 A FULL AND PROPER ANSWER
 IN WORDS CONSONANT WITH THEIR MODE OF LIFE


SAUTI SAID:
HAVING HEARD THE DIVERSE SACRED AND WONDERFUL STORIES COMPOSED IN HIS MAHABHARATA BY KRISHNADWAIPAYANA
 AND WHICH WERE RECITED IN FULL BY VAISAMPAYANA AT THE SNAKESACRIFICE OF THE HIGHSOULED ROYAL SAGE JANAMEJAYA AND IN THE PRESENCE ALSO OF THAT CHIEF OF PRINCES
 THE SON OF PARIKSHITA, HAVING WANDERED ABOUT
 VISITING MANY SACRED WATERS AND HOLY SHRINES
 I JOURNEYED TO THE COUNTRY VENERATED BY THE DWIJAS (TWICEBORN) AND CALLED SAMANTAPANCHAKA
 WHERE FORMERLY WERE FOUGHT THE BATTLES BETWEEN THE CHILDREN OF KURU AND PANDU
 AND ALL THE CHIEFS OF THE LAND RANGED ON EITHER SIDE
 THENCE
 BEING ANXIOUS TO SEE YOU
 I AM COME INTO YOUR PRESENCE
 YE REVEREND SAGES
 ALL OF WHOM ARE TO ME AS BRAHMA, YE GREATLY BLESSED
 WHO SHINE IN THIS PLACE OF SACRIFICE WITH THE SPLENDOUR OF THE SOLAR FIRE, YE WHO HAVE PERFORMED ABLUTIONS AND ARE PURE, YE WHO HAVE CONCLUDED THE SILENT MEDITATIONS AND HAVE FED THE HOLY FIRE, AND YE WHO ARE SITTING WITHOUT CARE, WHAT
 O YE DWIJAS
 (TWICEBORN) SHALL I REPEAT? SHALL I RECOUNT THE SACRED STORIES COLLECTED IN THE PURANAS CONTAINING PRECEPTS OF RELIGIOUS DUTY AND OF WORLDLY PROFIT
 OR THE ACTS OF ILLUSTRIOUS SAINTS AND SOVEREIGNS OF MANKIND?


THE RISHIS REPLIED:
THE PURANA
 FIRST PROMULGATED BY THE GREAT RISHI DWAIPAYANA
 AND WHICH AFTER HAVING BEEN HEARD BOTH BY THE GODS AND THE BRAHMARSHIS WAS HIGHLY ESTEEMED
 WHICH IS THE MOST EMINENT NARRATIVE THAT EXISTS DIVERSIFIED BOTH IN DICTION AND DIVISION
 POSSESSING SUBTILE MEANINGS LOGICALLY COMBINED
 AND EMBELLISHED FROM THE VEDAS
 IS A SACRED WORK
 COMPOSED IN ELEGANT LANGUAGE
 IT INCLUDETH THE SUBJECTS OF OTHER BOOKS
 IT IS ELUCIDATED BY OTHER SASTRAS
 AND COMPREHENDETH THE SENSE OF THE FOUR VEDAS
 `E ARE DESIROUS OF HEARING THAT HISTORY
 ALSO CALLED BHARATA
 THE HOLY COMPOSITION OF THE WONDERFUL VYASA
 WHICH DISPELLETH THE FEAR OF EVIL
 JUST AS IT WAS CHEERFULLY RECITED BY THE RISHI VAISHAMPAYANA
 UNDER THE DIRECTION OF DWAIPAYANA HIMSELF
 AT THE SNAKESACRIFICE OF RAJA JANAMEJAY?


SAUTI THEN SAID:
HAVING BOWED DOWN TO THE PRIMORDIAL MALE BEING ISANA
 TO WHOM MULTITUDES MAKE OFFERINGS
 AND WHO IS ADORED BY THE MULTITUDE, WHO IS THE TRUE INCORRUPTIBLE ONE
 BRAHMA
 PERCEPTIBLE
 IMPERCEPTIBLE
 ETERNAL, WHO IS BOTH A NONEXISTING AND AN EXISTINGNONEXISTING BEING, WHICH IS THE UNIVERSE AND ALSO DISTINCT FROM THE EXISTING AND NONEXISTING UNIVERSE, WHO IS THE CREATOR OF HIGH AND LOW, THE ANCIENT
 EXALTED
 INEXHAUSTIBLE ONE, WHO IS VISHNU
 THE BENEFICENT AND THE BENEFICENCE ITSELF
 WORTHY OF ALL PREFERENCE
 PURE AND IMMACULATE, WHO IS HARI
 THE RULER OF THE FACULTIES
 THE GUIDE OF ALL THINGS MOVEABLE AND IMMOVEABLE, I WILL DECLARE THE SACRED THOUGHTS OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS SAGE VYASA
 OF MARVELLOUS DEEDS AND WORSHIPPED HERE BY ALL
 SOME BARDS HAVE ALREADY PUBLISHED THIS HISTORY
 SOME ARE NOW TEACHING IT
 AND OTHERS
 IN LIKE MANNER
 WILL HEREAFTER PROMULGATE IT UPON THE EARTH
 IT IS A GREAT SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE
 ESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT THE THREE REGIONS OF THE WORLD
 IT IS POSSESSED BY THE TWICEBORN BOTH IN DETAILED AND COMPENDIOUS FORMS
 IT IS THE DELIGHT OF THE LEARNED FOR BEING EMBELLISHED WITH ELEGANT EXPRESSIONS
 CONVERSATIONS HUMAN AND DIVINE
 AND A VARIETY OF POETICAL MEASURES



IN THIS WORLD
 WHEN IT WAS DESTITUTE OF BRIGHTNESS AND LIGHT
 AND ENVELOPED ALL AROUND IN TOTAL DARKNESS
 THERE CAME INTO BEING
 AS THE PRIMAL CAUSE OF CREATION
 A MIGHTY EGG
 THE ONE INEXHAUSTIBLE SEED OF ALL CREATED BEINGS
 IT IS CALLED MAHADIVYA
 AND WAS FORMED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YUGA
 IN WHICH
 WE ARE TOLD
 WAS THE TRUE LIGHT BRAHMA
 THE ETERNAL ONE
 THE WONDERFUL AND INCONCEIVABLE BEING PRESENT ALIKE IN ALL PLACES, THE INVISIBLE AND SUBTILE CAUSE
 WHOSE NATURE PARTAKETH OF ENTITY AND NONENTITY
 FROM THIS EGG CAME THE LORD PITAMAHA
 BRAHMA
 THE ONE ONLY PRAJAPATI, WITH SURAGURU AND STHANU, SO MANU
 KA
 AND PARAMESHTI, ALSO PRACHETA AND DAKSHA
 AND THE SEVEN SONS OF DAKSHA
 THEN ALSO APPEARED THE TWENTYONE PRAJAPATIS
 AND THE MAN OF INCONCEIVABLE NATURE WHOM ALL THE RISHIS KNOW, SO THE VISWADEVAS
 THE ADITYAS
 THE VASUS
 AND THE TWIN ASWINAS, THE YAKSHAS
 THE SADHYAS
 THE PISACHAS
 THE GUHYAKAS
 AND THE PITRIS
 AFTER THESE WERE PRODUCED THE WISE AND MOST HOLY BRAHMARSHIS
 AND THE NUMEROUS RAJARSHIS DISTINGUISHED BY EVERY NOBLE QUALITY
 SO THE WATERS
 THE HEAVENS
 THE EARTH
 THE AIR
 THE SKY
 THE POINTS OF THE HEAVENS
 THE YEARS
 THE SEASONS
 THE MONTHS
 THE FORTNIGHTS
 CALLED PAKSHAS
 WITH DAY AND NIGHT IN DUE SUCCESSION
 AND THUS WERE PRODUCED ALL THINGS WHICH ARE KNOWN TO MANKIND



AND WHAT IS SEEN IN THE UNIVERSE
 WHETHER ANIMATE OR INANIMATE
 OF CREATED THINGS
 WILL
 AT THE END OF THE WORLD
 AND AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE YUGA
 BE AGAIN CONFOUNDED
 AND
 AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF OTHER YUGAS
 ALL THINGS WILL BE RENOVATED, AND
 LIKE THE VARIOUS FRUITS OF THE EARTH
 SUCCEED EACH OTHER IN THE DUE ORDER OF THEIR SEASONS
 THUS CONTINUETH PERPETUALLY TO REVOLVE IN THE WORLD
 WITHOUT BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END
 THIS WHEEL WHICH CAUSETH THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL THINGS



THE GENERATION OF DEVAS
 AS A BRIEF EXAMPLE
 WAS THIRTYTHREE THOUSAND THIRTYTHREE HUNDRED AND THIRTYTHREE
 THE SONS OF DIV WERE BRIHADBHANU
 CHAKSHUSH
 ATMA
 VIBHAVASU
 SAVITA
 RICHIKA
 ARKA
 BHANU
 ASHABAHA
 AND RAVI
 OF THESE VIVASWANS OF OLD
 MAHYA WAS THE YOUNGEST WHOSE SON WAS DEVABRATA
 THE LATTER HAD FOR HIS SON
 SUBRATA
 WHO
 WE LEARN
 HAD THREE SONS
DASAJYOTI
 SATAJYOTI
 AND SAHASRAJYOTI
 EACH OF THEM PRODUCING NUMEROUS OFFSPRING
 THE ILLUSTRIOUS DASAJYOTI HAD TEN THOUSAND
 SATAJYOTI TEN TIMES THAT NUMBER
 AND SAHASRAJYOTI TEN TIMES THE NUMBER OF SATAJYOTI'S OFFSPRINGS
 FROM THESE ARE DESCENDED THE FAMILY OF THE KURUS
 OF THE YADUS
 AND OF BHARATA, THE FAMILY OF YAYATI AND OF IKSHWAKU, ALSO OF ALL THE RAJARSHIS
 NUMEROUS ALSO WERE THE GENERATIONS PRODUCED
 AND VERY ABUNDANT WERE THE CREATURES AND THEIR PLACES OF ABODE
THE MYSTERY WHICH IS THREEFOLD
 THE VEDAS
 YOGA
 AND VIJNANA
DHARMA
 ARTHA
 AND KAMA
ALSO VARIOUS BOOKS UPON THE SUBJECT OF DHARMA
 ARTHA
 AND KAMA
ALSO RULES FOR THE CONDUCT OF MANKIND
 ALSO RULES FOR THE CONDUCT OF MANKIND
ALSO HISTORIES AND DISCOURSES
 WITH VARIOUS SRUTIS: ALL OF WHICH HAVING BEEN SEEN BY THE RISHI VYASA ARE HERE IN DUE ORDER MENTIONED AS A SPECIMEN OF THE BOOK



THE RISHI VYASA PUBLISHED THIS MASS OF KNOWLEDGE IN BOTH A DETAILED AND AN ABRIDGED FORM
 IT IS THE WISH OF THE LEARNED IN THE WORLD TO POSSESS THE DETAIL AND THE ABRIDGMENT
 SOME READ THE BHARATA BEGINNING WITH THE INITIAL MANTRA (INVOCATION) OTHERS WITH THE STORY OF ASTIKA
 OTHERS WITH UPARICHARA
 WHILE SOME BRAHMANAS STUDY THE WHOLE
 MEN OF LEARNING DISPLAY THEIR VARIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THE INSTITUTES IN COMMENTING ON THE COMPOSITION
 SOME ARE SKILFUL IN EXPLAINING IT
 WHILE OTHERS IN REMEMBERING ITS CONTENTS



THE SON OF SATYAVATI HAVING
 BY PENANCE AND MEDITATION
 ANALYSED THE ETERNAL VEDA
 AFTERWARDS COMPOSED THIS HOLY HISTORY
 AND WHEN THAT LEARNED BRAHMARSHI OF STRICT VOWS
 THE NOBLE DWAIPAYANA VYASA
 OFFSPRING OF PARASARA
 HAD FINISHED THIS GREATEST OF NARRATIONS
 HE BEGAN TO CONSIDER HOW HE MIGHT TEACH IT TO HIS DISCIPLES
 AND THE POSSESSOR OF THE SIX ATTRIBUTES
 BRAHMA
 THE WORLD'S PRECEPTOR
 ACQUAINTED WITH THE ANXIETY OF THE RISHI DWAIPAYANA
 CAME IN PERSON TO THE PLACE WHERE THE LATTER WAS
 FOR GRATIFYING THE SAINT
 AND BENEFITTING THE PEOPLE
 AND WHEN VYASA
 SURROUNDED BY ALL THE TRIBES OF MUNIS
 SAW HIM
 HE WAS SURPRISED, AND STANDING WITH JOINED PALMS
 HE BOWED AND HE ORDERED A SEAT TO BE BROUGHT
 AND VYASA HAVING GONE ROUND HIM WHO IS CALLED HIRANYAGARBHA SEATED ON THAT DISTINGUISHED SEAT
 STOOD NEAR IT, AND BEING COMMANDED BY BRAHMA PARAMESHTI
 HE SAT DOWN NEAR THE SEAT
 FULL OF AFFECTION AND SMILING IN JOY
 THEN THE GREATLY GLORIOUS VYASA
 ADDRESSING BRAHMA PARAMESHTI
 SAID
 'O DIVINE BRAHMA
 BY ME A POEM HATH BEEN COMPOSED WHICH IS GREATLY RESPECTED
 THE MYSTERY OF THE VEDA
 AND WHAT OTHER SUBJECTS HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED BY ME, THE VARIOUS RITUAL OF THE VEDAS AND OF THE UPANISHADS WITH THE ANGAS, THE COMPILATIONS OF THE PURANAS AND HISTORY FORMED BY ME AND NAMED AFTER THE THREE DIVISIONS OF TIME
 PAST
 PRESENT
 AND FUTURE, THE DETERMINATION OF THE NATURE OF DECAY
 DEATH
 FEAR
 DISEASE
 EXISTENCE
 AND NONEXISTENCE, A DESCRIPTION OF CREEDS AND OF THE VARIOUS MODES OF LIFE, RULES FOR THE FOUR CASTES
 AND THE IMPORT OF ALL THE PURANAS, AN ACCOUNT OF ASCETICISM AND OF THE DUTIES OF A RELIGIOUS STUDENT, THE DIMENSIONS OF THE SUN AND MOON
 THE PLANETS
 CONSTELLATIONS
 AND STARS
 TOGETHER WITH THAT OF THE FOUR AGES, THE RUK
 SAMA
 AND YAJUR VEDAS, ALSO THE ADHYATMA, THE SCIENCES CALLED NYAYA
 ORTHOEPY
 AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE, CHARITY AND PASUPATA, BIRTH
 CELESTIAL AND HUMAN
 FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSES, ALSO A DESCRIPTION OF PLACES OF PILGRIMAGE AND OTHER HOLY PLACES, OF RIVERS
 MOUNTAINS
 FORESTS
 AND THE OCEAN, OF HEAVENLY CITIES AND THE KALPAS, THE ART OF WAR, THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF NATIONS AND LANGUAGE, AND WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE MANNERS OF THE PEOPLE, AND THE ALLPERVADING SPIRIT, ALL THESE HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED
 BUT
 AFTER ALL
 NO WRITER OF THIS WORK IS TO BE FOUND ON EARTH
'


BRAHMA SAID: 'I ESTEEM THEE
 FOR THY KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE MYSTERIES
 BEFORE THE WHOLE BODY OF CELEBRATED MUNIS DISTINGUISHED FOR THE SANCTITY OF THEIR LIVES
 I KNOW THOU HAST REVEALED THE DIVINE WORD
 EVEN FROM ITS FIRST UTTERANCE
 IN THE LANGUAGE OF TRUTH
 THOU HAST CALLED THY PRESENT WORK A POEM
 WHEREFORE IT SHALL BE A POEM
 THERE SHALL BE NO POETS WHOSE WORKS MAY EQUAL THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS POEM
 EVEN AS THE THREE OTHER MODES
 CALLED ASRAMAS
 ARE EVER UNEQUAL IN MERIT TO THE DOMESTIC ASRAMA
 LET GANESA BE THOUGHT OF
 O MUNI
 FOR THE PURPOSE OF WRITING THE POEM
'


SAUTI SAID
 
BRAHMA HAVING THUS SPOKEN TO VYASA
 RETIRED TO HIS OWN ABODE
 THEN VYASA BEGAN TO CALL TO HIS REMEMBRANCE GANESA
 AND GANESA
 OBVIATOR OF OBSTACLES
 READY TO FULFIL THE DESIRES OF HIS VOTARIES
 WAS NO SOONER THOUGHT OF
 THAN HE REPAIRED TO THE PLACE WHERE VYASA WAS SEATED
 AND WHEN HE HAD BEEN SALUTED
 AND WAS SEATED
 VYASA ADDRESSED HIM THUS:'O GUIDE OF THE GANAS! BE THOU THE WRITER OF THE BHARATA WHICH I HAVE FORMED IN MY IMAGINATION
 AND WHICH I AM ABOUT TO REPEAT
'


GANESA
 UPON HEARING THIS ADDRESS
 THUS ANSWERED:'I WILL BECOME THE WRITER OF THY WORK
 PROVIDED MY PEN DO NOT FOR A MOMENT CEASE WRITING
' AND VYASA SAID UNTO THAT DIVINITY
 '`HEREVER THERE BE ANY THING THOU DOST NOT COMPREHEND
 CEASE TO CONTINUE WRITING
' GANESA HAVING SIGNIFIED HIS ASSENT
 BY REPEATING THE WORD OM! PROCEEDED TO WRITE, AND VYASA BEGAN, AND
 BY WAY OF DIVERSION
 HE KNIT THE KNOTS OF COMPOSITION EXCEEDING CLOSE, BY DOING WHICH
 HE DICTATED THIS WORK ACCORDING TO HIS ENGAGEMENT



I AM (CONTINUED SAUTI) ACQUAINTED WITH EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED VERSES
 AND SO IS SUKA
 AND
 PERHAPS
 SANJAYA
 FROM THE MYSTERIOUSNESS OF THEIR MEANING
 O MUNI
 NO ONE IS ABLE
 TO THIS DAY
 TO PENETRATE THOSE CLOSELY KNIT DIFFICULT SLOKAS
 GVEN THE OMNISCIENT GANESA TOOK A MOMENT TO CONSIDER, WHILE VYASA
 HOWEVER
 CONTINUED TO COMPOSE OTHER VERSES IN GREAT ABUNDANCE



THE WISDOM OF THIS WORK
 LIKE UNTO AN INSTRUMENT FOR APPLYING COLLYRIUM
 HATH OPENED THE EYES OF THE INQUISITIVE WORLD
 BLINDED BY THE DARKNESS OF IGNORANCE
 AS THE SUN DISPELLETH THE DARKNESS SO DOTH THE BHARATA BY ITS DISCOURSES ON RELIGION
 PROFIT
 PLEASURE AND FINAL RELEASE
 DISPELL THE IGNORANCE OF MEN
 AS THE FULL MOON BY ITS MILD LIGHT EXPANDETH THE BUDS OF THE WATERLILY
 SO THIS PURAN
 BY EXPOSING THE LIGHT OF THE SRUTI HATH EXPANDED THE HUMAN INTELLECT
 BY THE LAMP OF HISTORY
 WHICH DESTROYETH THE DARKNESS OF IGNORANCE
 THE WHOLE MANSION OF THE WOMB OF NATURE IS PROPERLY AND COMPLETELY ILLUMINATED



THIS WORK IS A TREE
 OF WHICH THE CHAPTER OF CONTENTS IS THE SEED, THE DIVISIONS CALLED PAULOMA AND ASTIKA ARE THE ROOT, THE PART CALLED SAMBHAVA IS THE TRUNK, THE BOOKS CALLED SABHA AND ARANYA ARE THE ROOSTING PERCHES, THE BOOK CALLED ARANI IS THE KNITTING KNOTS, THE BOOKS CALLED VIRATA AND UDYOGA THE PITH, THE BOOK NAMED BHISHMA
 THE MAIN BRANCH, THE BOOK CALLED DRONA
 THE LEAVES, THE BOOK CALLED KARNA
 THE FAIR FLOWERS, THE BOOK NAMED SALYA
 THEIR SWEET SMELL, THE BOOKS ENTITLED STRI AND AISHIKA
 THE REFRESHING SHADE, THE BOOK CALLED SANTI
 THE MIGHTY FRUIT, THE BOOK CALLED ASWAMEDHA
 THE IMMORTAL SAP, THE BOOK DENOMINATED ASRAMAVASIKA
 THE SPOT WHERE IT GROWETH, AND THE BOOK CALLED MAUSALA
 IS AN EPITOME OF THE VEDAS AND HELD IN GREAT RESPECT BY THE VIRTUOUS BRAHMANS
 THE TREE OF THE BHARATA
 INEXHAUSTIBLE TO MANKIND AS THE CLOUDS
 SHALL BE AS A SOURCE OF LIVELIHOOD TO ALL DISTINGUISHED POETS



SAUTI CONTINUED
 
I WILL NOW SPEAK OF THE UNDYING FLOWERY AND FRUITFUL PRODUCTIONS OF THIS TREE
 POSSESSED OF PURE AND PLEASANT TASTE
 AND NOT TO BE DESTROYED EVEN BY THE IMMORTALS
 FORMERLY
 THE SPIRITED AND VIRTUOUS KRISHNA DWAIPAYANA
 BY THE INJUNCTIONS OF VISHMA
 THE WISE SON OF GANGA AND OF HIS OWN MOTHER
 BECAME THE FATHER OF THREE BOYS
 WHO WERE LIKE THE THREE FIRES
 BY THE TWO WIVES OF VICHITRAVIRYA, AND HAVING THUS RAISED UP DHRITARASHTRA
 PANDU AND VIDURA
 HE RETURNED TO HIS RECLUSE ABODE TO PROSECUTE HIS RELIGIOUS EXERCISES



IT WAS NOT TILL AFTER THESE WERE BORN
 GROWN UP
 AND DEPARTED ON THE SUPREME JOURNEY
 THAT THE GREAT RISHI VYASA PUBLISHED THE BHARATA IN THIS THE REGION OF MANKIND, WHEN BEING SOLICITED BY JANAMEJAYA AND THOUSANDS OF BRAHMANS
 HE INSTRUCTED HIS DISCIPLE VAISAMPAYANA
 WHO WAS SEATED NEAR HIM, AND HE
 SITTING TOGETHER WITH THE SADASYAS
 RECITED THE BHARATA
 DURING THE INTERVALS OF THE CEREMONIES OF THE SACRIFICE
 BEING REPEATEDLY URGED TO PROCEED



VYASA HATH FULLY REPRESENTED THE GREATNESS OF THE HOUSE OF KURU
 THE VIRTUOUS PRINCIPLES OF GANDHARI
 THE WISDOM OF VIDURA
 AND THE CONSTANCY OF KUNTI
 THE NOBLE RISHI HATH ALSO DESCRIBED THE DIVINITY OF VASUDEVA
 THE RECTITUDE OF THE SONS OF PANDU
 AND THE EVIL PRACTICES OF THE SONS AND PARTISANS OF DHRITARASHTRA



VYASA EXECUTED THE COMPILATION OF THE BHARATA
 EXCLUSIVE OF THE EPISODES
 ORIGINALLY IN TWENTYFOUR THOUSAND VERSES, AND SO MUCH ONLY IS CALLED BY THE LEARNED AS THE BHARATA
 AFTERWARDS HE COMPOSED AN EPITOME IN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY VERSES
 CONSISTING OF THE INTRODUCTION WITH THE CHAPTER OF CONTENTS
 THIS HE FIRST TAUGHT TO HIS SON SUKA, AND AFTERWARDS HE GAVE IT TO OTHERS OF HIS DISCIPLES WHO WERE POSSESSED OF THE SAME QUALIFICATIONS
 AFTER THAT HE EXECUTED ANOTHER COMPILATION
 CONSISTING OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND VERSES
 OF THESE
 THIRTY HUNDRED THOUSAND ARE KNOWN IN THE WORLD OF THE DEVAS, FIFTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE WORLD OF THE PITRIS, FOURTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND AMONG THE GANDHARVAS
 AND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE REGIONS OF MANKIND
 NARADA RECITED THEM TO THE DEVAS
 DEVALA TO THE PITRIS
 AND SUKA PUBLISHED THEM TO THE GANDHARVAS
 YAKSHAS
 AND RAKSHASAS, AND IN THIS WORLD THEY WERE RECITED BY VAISAMPAYANA
 ONE OF THE DISCIPLES OF VYASA
 A MAN OF JUST PRINCIPLES AND THE FIRST AMONG ALL THOSE ACQUAINTED WITH THE VEDAS
 KNOW THAT I
 SAUTI
 HAVE ALSO REPEATED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND VERSES



DURJODHANA IS A GREAT TREE FORMED OF PASSION
 KARNA IS ITS TRUNK, SAKUNI IS ITS BRANCHES, DUSSHASANA
 ITS FULLGROWN FRUIT AND FLOWERS, AND THE WEAKMINDED RAJA DHRITARASHTRA
 ITS ROOTS



YUDHISHTHIRA IS A VAST TREE
 FORMED OF RELIGION AND VIRTUE, ARJUNA IS ITS TRUNK, BHIMASENA
 ITS BRANCHES, THE TWO SONS OF MADRI ARE ITS FULL GROWN FRUIT AND FLOWERS, AND ITS ROOTS ARE KRISHNA
 BRAHMA
 AND THE BRAHMANAS



PANDU
 AFTER HAVING SUBDUED MANY COUNTRIES BY HIS WISDOM AND PROWESS
 TOOK UP HIS ABODE WITH THE MUNIS IN A CERTAIN FOREST AS A SPORTSMAN
 WHERE HE BROUGHT UPON HIMSELF A VERY SEVERE MISFORTUNE FOR HAVING KILLED A STAG COUPLING WITH ITS MATE
 WHICH SERVED AS A WARNING FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE PRINCES OF HIS HOUSE AS LONG AS THEY LIVED
 THEIR MOTHERS
 THAT THE ORDINANCES OF THE LAW MIGHT BE FULFILLED
 ADMITTED AS SUBSTITUTES TO THEIR EMBRACES THE GODS DHARMA
 VAYU
 SAKRA
 AND THE DIVINITIES THE TWIN ASWINAS
 AND WHEN THEIR OFFSPRINGS WERE GROWN UP
 UNDER THE CARE OF THEIR TWO MOTHERS
 IN THE SOCIETY OF ASCETICS
 IN THE MIDST OF SACRED GROVES AND HOLY RECLUSE ABODES OF RELIGIOUS MEN
 THEY WERE CONDUCTED BY RISHIS INTO THE PRESENCE OF DHRITARASHTRA AND HIS SONS
 FOLLOWING AS STUDENTS IN THE HABIT OF BRAHMACHARIS
 HAVING THEIR HAIR TIED IN KNOTS ON THEIR HEADS
 'THESE OUR PUPILS
' SAID THEY
 'ARE AS YOUR SONS
 YOUR BROTHERS
 AND YOUR FRIENDS, THEY ARE PANDAVAS
' SAYING THIS
 THE MUNIS DISAPPEARED



`HEN THE KAURAVAS SAW THEM INTRODUCED AS THE SONS OF PANDU
 THE DISTINGUISHED CLASS OF CITIYENS SHOUTED EXCEEDINGLY FOR JOY
 SOME
 HOWEVER
 SAID
 THEY WERE NOT THE SONS OF PANDU, OTHERS SAID
 THEY WERE, WHILE A FEW ASKED HOW THEY COULD BE HIS OFFSPRING
 SEEING HE HAD BEEN SO LONG DEAD
 STILL ON ALL SIDES VOICES WERE HEARD CRYING
 'THEY ARE ON ALL ACCOUNTS WELCOME! THROUGH DIVINE PROVIDENCE WE BEHOLD THE FAMILY OF PANDU! LET THEIR WELCOME BE PROCLAIMED!' AS THESE ACCLAMATIONS CEASED
 THE PLAUDITS OF INVISIBLE SPIRITS
 CAUSING EVERY POINT OF THE HEAVENS TO RESOUND
 WERE TREMENDOUS
 THERE WERE SHOWERS OF SWEETSCENTED FLOWERS
 AND THE SOUNDS OF SHELLS AND KETTLEDRUMS
 SUCH WERE THE WONDERS THAT HAPPENED ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCES
 THE JOYFUL NOISE OF ALL THE CITIYENS
 IN EXPRESSION OF THEIR SATISFACTION ON THE OCCASION
 WAS SO GREAT THAT IT REACHED THE VERY HEAVENS IN MAGNIFYING PLAUDITS



HAVING STUDIED THE WHOLE OF THE VEDAS AND SUNDRY OTHER SHASTRAS
 THE PANDAVAS RESIDED THERE
 RESPECTED BY ALL AND WITHOUT APPREHENSION FROM ANY ONE



THE PRINCIPAL MEN WERE PLEASED WITH THE PURITY OF YUDHISHTHIRA
 THE FORTITUDE OF BHIMASENA
 THE COURAGE OF ARJUNA
 THE SUBMISSIVE ATTENTION OF KUNTI TO HER SUPERIORS
 AND THE HUMILITY OF THE TWINS NAKULA AND SAHADEVA, AND ALL THE PEOPLE REJOICED BECAUSE OF THEIR HEROIC VIRTUES



AFTER A WHILE
 ARJUNA OBTAINED THE VIRGIN KIRSHN AT THE SWAYAMVARA
 IN THE MIDST OF A CONCOURSE OF RAJAS
 BY PERFORMING A VERY DIFFICULT FEAT OF ARCHERY
 AND FROM THIS TIME HE BECAME VERY MUCH RESPECTED IN THIS WORLD AMONG ALL BOWMEN, AND IN FIELDS OF BATTLE ALSO
 LIKE THE SUN
 HE WAS HARD TO BE BEHELD BY FOEMEN
 AND HAVING VANQUISHED ALL THE NEIGHBOURING PRINCES AND EVERY CONSIDERABLE TRIBE
 HE ACCOMPLISHED ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE RAJA (HIS ELDEST BROTHER) TO PERFORM THE GREAT SACRIFICE CALLED RAJASUYA



YUDHISHTHIRA
 AFTER HAVING
 THROUGH THE WISE COUNSELS OF VSUDEVA AND BY THE VALOR OF BHIMASENA AND ARJUNA
 SLAIN JARASANDHA (THE KING OF MAGADHA) AND THE PROUD CHAIDYA
 ACQUIRED THE RIGHT TO PERFORM THE GRAND SACRIFICE OF RAJASUYA ABOUNDING IN PROVISIONS AND OFFERINGS AND FRAUGHT WITH TRANSCENDENT MERITS
 AND DURYODHANA CAME TO THIS SACRIFICE, AND WHEN HE BEHELD THE VAST WEALTH OF THE PANDAVAS SCATTERED ALL AROUND, THE OFFERINGS, THE PRECIOUS STONES
 GOLD
 AND JEWELS, THE WEALTH IN COWS
 ELEPHANTS
 AND HORSES, THE CURIOUS TEXTURES
 GARMENTS
 AND MANTLES, THE PRECIOUS SHAWLS AND FURS
 WITH CARPETS MADE OF THE SKIN OF THE RANKU, HE WAS FILLED WITH ENVY AND BECAME EXCEEDINGLY DISPLEASED
 AND WHEN HE BEHELD THE HALL OF ASSEMBLY ELEGANTLY CONSTRUCTED BY MAYA (THE ASURA ARCHITECT) AFTER THE FASHION OF A CELESTIAL COURT
 HE WAS INFLAMED WITH RAGE
 AND HAVING STARTED IN CONFUSION AT CERTAIN ARCHITECTURAL DECEPTIONS WITHIN THIS BUILDING
 HE WAS DERIDED BY BHIMASENA IN THE PRESENCE OF VSUDEVA
 LIKE ONE OF MEAN DESCENT



AND IT WAS REPRESENTED TO DHRITARASHTRA THAT HIS SON
 WHILE PARTAKING OF VARIOUS OBJECTS OF ENJOYMENT AND DIVERSE PRECIOUS THINGS
 WAS BECOMING MEAGRE
 WAN
 AND PALE
 AND DHRITARASHTRA
 SOMETIME AFTER
 OUT OF AFFECTION FOR HIS SON
 GAVE HIS CONSENT TO THEIR PLAYING (WITH THE PANDAVAS) AT DICE
 AND VSUDEVA COMING TO KNOW OF THIS
 BECAME EXCEEDING WROTH
 AND BEING DISSATISFIED
 HE DID NOTHING TO PREVENT THE DISPUTES
 BUT OVERLOOKED THE GAMING AND SUNDRY OTHER HORRID UNJUSTIFIABLE TRANSACTIONS ARISING THEREFROM, AND IN SPITE OF VIDURA
 BHISHMA
 DRONA
 AND KRIPA THE SON OF SHARADWAN
 HE MADE THE KSHETRIAS KILL EACH OTHER IN THE TERRIFIC WAR THE ENSUED



AND DHRITARASHTRA HEARING THE ILL NEWS OF THE SUCCESS OF THE PANDAVAS AND RECOLLECTING THE RESOLUTIONS OF DURYODHANA
 KARNA
 AND SAKUNI
 PONDERED FOR A WHILE AND ADDRESSED SANJAYA THE FOLLOWING SPEECH:

'ATTEND
 O SANJAYA
 TO ALL I AM ABOUT TO SAY
 AND IT WILL NOT BECOME THEE TO TREAT ME WITH CONTEMPT
 THOU ART WELL VERSED IN THE SHASTRAS
 INTELLIGENT
 AND ENDUED WITH WISDOM
 MY INCLINATIONS WERE NEVER FOR WAR
 NOR DID I DELIGHT IN THE DESTRUCTION OF MY RACE
 I MADE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN MY OWN CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN OF PANDU
 MY OWN SONS WERE PRONE TO WILFULNESS AND DESPISED ME BECAUSE I AM OLD
 BLIND AS I AM
 BECAUSE OF MY MISERABLE PLIGHT AND THROUGH PATERNAL AFFECTION
 I BORE IT ALL
 I WAS FOOLISH AFTER THE THOUGHTLESS DURYODHANA EVER GROWING IN FOLLY
 HAVING BEEN A SPECTATOR OF THE RICHES OF THE MIGHTY SONS OF PANDU
 MY SON WAS DERIDED FOR HIS AWKWARDNESS WHILE ASCENDING THE HALL
 UNABLE TO BEAR IT ALL AND UNABLE HIMSELF TO OVERCOME THE SONS OF PANDU IN THE FIELD
 AND THOUGH A SOLDIER
 UNWILLING YET TO OBTAIN GOOD FORTUNE BY HIS OWN EXERTIONS
 WITH THE HELP OF THE KING OF GANDHARA
 HE CONCERTED AN UNFAIR GAME AT DICE


'HEAR
 O SANJAYA
 ALL THAT HAPPENED THEREUPON AND CAME TO MY KNOWLEDGE
 AND WHEN THOU HAST HEARD ALL I SAY RECOLLECTING EVERYTHING AS IT FELL OUT
 THOU SHALT THEN KNOW ME FOR ONCE WITH A PROPHETIC EYE
 `HEN I HEARD THAT ARJUNA
 HAVING BENT THE BOW
 HAD PIERCED THE CURIOUS MARK AND BROUGHT IT TO THE GROUND
 AND BORE AWAY IN TRIUMPH THE MAIDEN KRISHN
 IN THE SIGHT OF THE ASSEMBLED PRINCES
 THEN
 O SANJAYA
 I HAD NO HOPE OF SUCCESS
 `HEN I HEARD THAT SUBHADRA OF THE RACE OF MADHU HAD
 AFTER FORCIBLE SEIYURE

 THE BROTHERS OF SUBHADRA) WITHOUT RESENTING IT HAD ENTERED INDRAPRASTHA AS FRIENDS
 THEN
 O SANJAYA

 AND THAT VIDURA WAS ENGAGED IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THEIR DESIGNS
 THEN

 AFTER HAVING PIERCED THE MARK IN THE ARENA HAD WON DRAUPADI
 AND THAT THE BRAVE PANCHALAS HAD JOINED THE PANDAVAS
 THEN
 O SANJAYA
 I HAD NO HOPE OF SUCCESS
 `HEN I HEARD THAT JARASANDHA
 THE FOREMOST OF THE ROYAL LINE OF MAGADHA AND BLAYING IN THE MIDST OF THE KSHETRIAS

 THEN
 O SANJAYA

 `HEN I HEARD THAT IN THEIR GENERAL CAMPAIGN THE SONS OF PANDU HAD CONQUERED THE CHIEFS OF THE LAND AND PERFORMED THE GRAND SACRIFICE OF THE RAJASUYA
 THEN
 O SANJAYA
 I HAD NO HOPE OF SUCCESS
 `HEN I HEARD THAT DRAUPADI
 HER VOICE CHOKED WITH TEARS AND HEART FULL OF AGONY
 IN THE SEASON OF IMPURITY AND WITH BUT ONE RAIMENT ON
 HAD BEEN DRAGGED INTO COURT AND THOUGH SHE HAD PROTECTORS HAD BEEN TREATED AS IF SHE HAD NONE
 THEN
 O SANJAYA
 I HAD NO HOPE OF SUCCESS
 `HEN I HEARD THAT THE WICKED WRETCH DUSHSAHANA
 IN STRIVING TO STRIP HER OF THAT SINGLE GARMENT
 HAD ONLY DRAWN FROM HER PERSON A LARGE HEAP OF CLOTH WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO ARRIVE AT ITS END
 THEN
 O SANJAYA
 I HAD NO HOPE OF SUCCESS
 `HEN I HEARD THAT YUDHISHTHIRA
 BEATEN BY SAUBALA AT THE GAME OF DICE AND DEPRIVED OF HIS KINGDOM AS THE CONSEQUENCE THEREOF
 HAD STILL BEEN ATTENDED UPON BY HIS BROTHERS OF INCOMPARABLE PROWESS
 THEN O SANJAYA
 I HAD NO HOPE OF SUCCESS
 `HEN I HEARD THAT THE VIRTUOUS PANDAVAS WEEPING WITH AFFLICTION HAD FOLLOWED THEIR ELDER BROTHER TO THE WILDERNESS AND EXERTED THEMSELVES VARIOUSLY FOR THE MITIGATION OF HIS DISCOMFORTS
 THEN
 O SANJAYA
 I HAD NO HOPE OF SUCCESS


'`HEN I HEARD THAT YUDHISHTHIRA HAD BEEN FOLLOWED INTO THE WILDERNESS BY SNATAKAS AND NOBLEMINDED BRAHMANAS WHO LIVE UPON ALMS

 THEN
 O SANJAYA
 I HAD NO HOPE OF SUCCESS
 `HEN I HEARD THAT ARJUNA

 THEN

 SEVEN, IN THAT DREADFUL CONFLICT EIGHTEEN AKSHAUHINIS OF KSHETRIAS HAVE BEEN SLAIN! ALL AROUND ME IS UTTER DARKNESS
 AND A FIT OF SWOON ASSAILETH ME: CONSCIOUSNESS LEAVES ME
 O SUTA
 AND MY MIND IS DISTRACTED
'


SAUTI SAID
 
DHRITARASHTRA
 BEWAILING HIS FATE IN THESE WORDS
 WAS OVERCOME WITH EXTREME ANGUISH AND FOR A TIME DEPRIVED OF SENSE, BUT BEING REVIVED
 HE ADDRESSED SANJAYA IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS:

'AFTER WHAT HATH COME TO PASS
 O SANJAYA
 I WISH TO ABANDON LIFE WITHOUT DELAY, I DO NOT SEE THE LEAST ADVANTAGE IN CHERISHING IT ANY LONGER
'


SAUTI SAID

THE WISE SON OF GAVALGANA
 (SANJAYA) THEN ADDRESSED THE DISTRESSED LORD OF GARTH WHILE THUS TALKING AND BEWAILING
 SIGHING LIKE A SERPENT AND REPEATEDLY FAINTING
 IN THESE WORDS OF DEEP IMPORT:

'THOU HAST HEARD
 O RAJA
 OF THE GREATLY POWERFUL MEN OF VAST EXERTIONS
 SPOKEN OF BY VYASA AND THE WISE NARADA, MEN BORN OF GREAT ROYAL FAMILIES
 RESPLENDENT WITH WORTHY QUALITIES
 VERSED IN THE SCIENCE OF CELESTIAL ARMS

 AND BY WHOSE SACRIFICIAL ALTARS AND STAKES THIS EARTH WITH HER HABITED AND UNINHABITED REGIONS HATH BEEN MARKED ALL OVER
 THESE TWENTYFOUR RAJAS WERE FORMERLY SPOKEN OF BY THE CELESTIAL RISHI NARADA UNTO SAIVYA WHEN MUCH AFFLICTED FOR THE LOSS OF HIS CHILDREN
 BESIDES THESE

 AND STILL OTHERS BY MILLIONS
 PRINCES OF GREAT POWER AND WISDOM
 QUITTING VERY ABUNDANT ENJOYMENTS
 MET DEATH AS THY SONS HAVE DONE! THEIR HEAVENLY DEEDS
 VALOR
 AND GENEROSITY
 THEIR MAGNANIMITY
 FAITH
 TRUTH
 PURITY
 SIMPLICITY AND MERCY
 ARE PUBLISHED TO THE WORLD IN THE RECORDS OF FORMER TIMES BY SACRED BARDS OF GREAT LEARNING
 THOUGH ENDUED WITH EVERY NOBLE VIRTUE

 O BHRATA
 AND ART INTELLIGENT AND WISE, THEY NEVER SINK UNDER MISFORTUNES WHOSE UNDERSTANDINGS ARE GUIDED BY THE SHASTRAS

 ALL STATES
 THE GOOD AND THE EVIL
 IN THE THREE WORLDS
 ARE CAUSED BY TIME
 TIME CUTTETH SHORT ALL THINGS AND CREATETH THEM ANEW
 TIME ALONE IS AWAKE WHEN ALL THINGS ARE ASLEEP: INDEED
 TIME IS INCAPABLE OF BEING OVERCOME
 TIME PASSETH OVER ALL THINGS WITHOUT BEING RETARDED
 KNOWING AS THOU DOST THAT ALL THINGS PAST AND FUTURE AND ALL THAT EXIST AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
 ARE THE OFFSPRINGS OF TIME
 IT BEHOVETH THEE NOT TO ABANDON THY REASON
'


SAUTI SAID:
THE SON OF GAVALGANI
 HAVING IN THIS MANNER ADMINISTERED COMFORT TO THE ROYAL DHRITARASHTRA OVERWHELMED WITH GRIEF FOR HIS SONS
 THEN RESTORED HIS MIND TO PEACE
 TAKING THESE FACTS FOR HIS SUBJECT
 DWAIPAYANA COMPOSED A HOLY UPANISHAD THAT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED TO THE WORLD BY LEARNED AND SACRED BARDS IN THE PURANAS COMPOSED BY THEM



THE STUDY OF THE BHARATA IS AN ACT OF PIETY
 HE THAT READETH EVEN ONE FOOT
 BELIEVING
 HATH HIS SINS ENTIRELY PURGED AWAY
 HEREIN DEVAS
 DEVARSHIS
 AND IMMACULATE BRAHMARSHIS OF GOOD DEEDS
 HAVE BEEN SPOKEN OF, AND LIKEWISE YAKHAS AND GREAT URAGAS (NAGAS)
 HEREIN ALSO HATH BEEN DESCRIBED THE ETERNAL VSUDEVA POSSESSING THE SIX ATTRIBUTES
 HE IS THE TRUE AND JUST
 THE PURE AND HOLY
 THE ETERNAL BRAHMA
 THE SUPREME SOUL
 THE TRUE AND CONSTANT LIGHT
 WHOSE DIVINE DEEDS WISE AND LEARNED MEN RECOUNT, FROM WHOM HATH PROCEEDED THE NONEXISTENT AND EXISTENTNONEXISTENT UNIVERSE WITH PRINCIPLES OF GENERATION AND PROGRESSION
 AND BIRTH
 DEATH
 AND REBIRTH
 THAT ALSO HATH BEEN TREATED OF WHICH IS CALLED ADHYATMA (THE SUPERINTENDING SPIRIT OF NATURE) THAT PARTAKETH THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE FIVE ELEMENTS
 THAT ALSO HATH BEEN DESCRIBED WHO IS PURUSHA BEING ABOVE SUCH EPITHETS AS 'UNDISPLAYED' AND THE LIKE, ALSO THAT WHICH THE FIRST OF YOTIS EXEMPT FROM THE COMMON DESTINY AND ENDUED WITH THE POWER OF MEDITATION AND TAPA BEHOLD DEWELLING IN THEIR HEARTS AS A REFLECTED IMAGE IN THE MIRROR



THE MAN OF FAITH
 DEVOTED TO PIETY
 AND CONSTANT IN THE EXERCISE OF VIRTUE
 ON READING THIS SECTION IS FREED FROM SIN
 THE BELIEVER THAT CONSTANTLY HEARETH RECITED THIS SECTION OF THE BHARATA
 CALLED THE INTRODUCTION
 FROM THE BEGINNING
 FALLETH NOT INTO DIFFICULTIES
 THE MAIN REPEATING ANY PART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN THE TWO TWILIGHTS IS DURING SUCH ACT FREED FROM THE SINS AMASSED DURING THE DAY OR THE NIGHT
 THIS SECTION
 THE BODY OF THE BHARATA
 IS TRUTH AND NECTAR
 AS BUTTER IS AMONG CURDS
 BRAHMANA AMONG BIPEDS
 THE ARANYAKA AMONG THE VEDAS
 AND NECTAR AMONG MEDICINES, AS THE SEA IS EMINENT AMONG RECEPTACLES OF WATER
 AND THE COW AMONG QUADRUPEDS, AS ARE THESE (AMONG THE THINGS MENTIONED) SO IS THE BHARATA SAID TO BE AMONG HISTORIES



HE THAT CAUSETH IT
 EVEN A SINGLE FOOT THEREOF
 TO BE RECITED TO BRAHMANS DURING A SRADHA
 HIS OFFERINGS OF FOOD AND DRINK TO THE MANES OF HIS ANCESTORS BECOME INEXHAUSTIBLE



BY THE AID OF HISTORY AND THE PURANAS
 THE VEDA MAY BE EXPOUNDED, BUT THE VEDA IS AFRAID OF ONE OF LITTLE INFORMATION LEST HE SHOULD INJURE IT
 THE LEARNED MAN WHO RECITES TO OTHERS THIS VEDA OF VYASA REAPETH ADVANTAGE
 IT MAY WITHOUT DOUBT DESTROY EVEN THE SIN OF KILLING THE EMBRYO AND THE LIKE
 HE THAT READETH THIS HOLY CHAPTER AT EVERY CHANGE OF THE MOON
 READETH THE WHOLE OF THE BHARATA
 I WEEN
 THE MAN WHO WITH REVERENCE DAILY LISTENETH TO THIS SACRED WORK ACQUIRETH LONG LIFE AND RENOWN AND ASCENDETH TO HEAVEN



IN FORMER DAYS
 HAVING PLACED THE FIVE VEDAS ON ONE SIDE AND THE BHARATA ON THE OTHER
 THESE WERE WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE BY THE CELESTIALS ASSEMBLED FOR THAT PURPOSE
 AND AS THE LATTER WEIGHED HEAVIER THAN THE FOUR VEDAS WITH THEIR MYSTERIES
 FROM THAT PERIOD IT HATH BEEN CALLED IN THE WORLD MAHABHARATA (THE GREAT BHARATA), FOR IT BEING ESTEEMED SUPERIOR BOTH IN SUBSTANCE AND GRAVITY OF IMPORT IS DENOMINATED MAHABHARATA FROM SUCH SUBSTANCE AND GRAVITY OF IMPORT
 HE THAT KNOWETH ITS MEANING IS SAVED FROM ALL SINS



TAPA IS INNOCENT
 STUDY IS HARMLESS
 THE ORDINANCES OF THE VEDAS PRESCRIBED FOR ALL THE TRIBES ARE HARMLESS
 THE ACQUISITION OF WEALTH BY EXERTION IS HARMLESS, BUT WHEN THESE ARE ABUSED IN THEIR PRACTICE IT IS THEN THAT THEY BECOME SOURCES OF EVIL
